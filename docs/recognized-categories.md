# Categories

The categories being exact is what ensures that these extensions can be easily used.

The full list of categories must be short enough to reasonably expect every consumer to check.

Below are recognized values:

  - `source code`: Refers to files that are written in a programming language
  - `version control`: Refers to files that are directly used for version control. Likely themselves never written directly to.
  - `text`: Refers to any file that is largely general purpose in use, and represents simple text. Such a TXT, CSV, or TSV.

ext: [ cfg, conf, config, htaccess ],
name: configuration file

ext: dtd
name: document type definition
